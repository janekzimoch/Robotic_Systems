# Arduino code written for Robotic Systems modules (Portfolio repository)
Here you can see code I wrote to control a ROMI two-wheeled robot. The task was for the robot to autonomously complete a course using a range of sensors such as: diodes (for line tracing), magentometer, gyroscope, wheel rotation encoders etc.
A final report for this coursework is also attached.
